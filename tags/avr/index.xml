      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished this little project back in 2016 when I had two Xbox 360 wireless controllers and a huge desire to use them with a PC. To do so, you have to have a wireless receiver, and there were 2 mainstream options on the market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a genuine one - the best option, but costs around $60;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an unofficial replica - can be found for $10-15, but reliability and driver support were quite questionable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I was short of money to get the first one and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to try luck with the second. Fortunately, if you dive a bit deeper into the topic and doesn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to do some soldering, there&amp;rsquo;s a third option - using an RF module from a broken Xbox 360 (later in the text I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to it just as &amp;ldquo;RF module&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
